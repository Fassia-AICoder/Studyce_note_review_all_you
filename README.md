# 📘 Studyce: Note, Review, All You

> 🗣️ *This project is part of my journey to improve both my programming and language skills while learning English and Chinese. It was developed using English as a non-native French speaker (B2 level).*

## 🧠 Concept

**Studyce** is a personal knowledge assistant designed to help users *capture and actively review* anything they're learning—starting with languages, and eventually expanding to **every kind of knowledge** imaginable. Inspired by my own experience learning English and Chinese, this platform was born out of a real problem: reviewing what I learned in a way that actually matched how I retain information.

Whether it's vocabulary, grammar, or completely different subjects, Studyce lets users:

- Add notes from what they learn daily  
- Review them interactively using quizzes and more  
- Build their own exercises or follow system-generated ones  
- Control the review flow in the way that suits *their* learning style  

I wanted users to be able to customize their experience—adjusting dashboard colors, choosing fonts, and organizing their learning pace the way they want.

## 🚀 Project Status

I’ve already started building **Studyce** as a full-stack web application using **Python and Flask**.  
The backend structure and routing are in place. I’m currently designing the frontend with **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**, and developing early interface features.

## 💡 Why It Matters

Every day I learn something new—from different subjects to language expressions—and traditional review methods don’t always fit the way I think.  
**Studyce** is my answer: a smarter system that lets *me* decide how and what to review, making learning more **personal, efficient, and enjoyable**.

Over time, I plan to expand this platform so others can also benefit—students, self-learners, or anyone mastering complex topics.
